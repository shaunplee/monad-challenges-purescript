title: Combinations of three things
---

Our `allCombs` function is more general but it still only lets us generate
combinations of two things. Now implement an `allCombs3` function that generates
combinations of 3 things. Don't try to do anything fancy yet. Just use the most
straightforward approach you can think of.

    allCombs3 :: forall a b c d. (a -> b -> c -> d) -> Array a -> Array b -> Array c -> Array d

For convenience, `MCPrelude` defines a data `Triple` with `Show` instance, e.g.:

    > Triple 42 "hello" 3.141
    (42,"hello",3.141)

Here is example output to check your `allCombs3` function.

    allCombs3 Triple [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] == [(1,3,5),(1,3,6),(1,4,5),(1,4,6),(2,3,5),(2,3,6),(2,4,5),(2,4,6)]
