title: Random Number Generation
---

In MCPrelude we provide a simple random number generation function
`rand`.  Random number generators usually rely on mutable state side effects.
They maintain some state somewhere in memory and use that to figure out what
"random" number to give you.  Before the function returns, it modifies the
mutable state so that the next time you call the function you'll get a
different number.  Purescript is a pure functional programming language and
because our custom Prelude hides Purescript's mechanisms for dealing with side
effects, we can't build a random number generator that way.  Our random number
generator has to have everything it needs passed in and it has to return
everything it modifies.  Therefore, it has this type signature:

    rand :: Seed -> { newVal :: Int, newSeed :: Seed }

You can construct seeds with the `mkSeed` function.

    mkSeed :: Int -> Seed

Make a function that gives you the first five random numbers starting with a
seed of `(mkSeed 1)`.  Call it:

    fiveRands :: Array Int

For now don't try to do anything fancy.  Just implement it in the most
straightforward way that comes to mind.  To check your answers, the product of
these numbers is 492745054.
