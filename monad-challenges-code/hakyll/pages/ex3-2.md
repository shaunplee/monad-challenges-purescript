title: Poker hands

We can use the `allPairs` function to do things like generate poker hands.  In
MCPrelude we have defined two lists called `cardRanks` and `cardSuits`.  Try
calling your `allPairs` function on these:

    allPairs cardRanks cardSuits == [(Tuple 2 "H"),(Tuple 2 "D"),(Tuple 2 "C"),(Tuple 2 "S"),(Tuple 3 "H"),(Tuple 3 "D"),(Tuple 3 "C"),(Tuple 3 "S"),(Tuple 4 "H"),(Tuple 4 "D"),(Tuple 4 "C"),(Tuple 4 "S"),(Tuple 5 "H"),(Tuple 5 "D"),(Tuple 5 "C"),(Tuple 5 "S")]

But this isn't a very nice representation.  We want a more concise
representation of the card to show our user.  If you were writing a real
poker-related program, instead of using a tuple you would probably create a
data type `Card`.  Do that now and then write a `Show` instance for it that
returns the more concise representation `"2H"`, `"2D"`, etc.

    show (Card 2 "h") == "2h"

Now create a new function `allCards` that does the same thing as your `allPairs`
function but uses your new `Card` data type instead.  It should have the
following type signature:

    allCards :: Array Int -> Array String -> Array Card

This function should do the same thing as `allPairs`, but with more concise
output.  When you write this function, don't implement it using your previous
`allPairs` function.  Rewrite it.

    show (allCards cardRanks cardSuits) == "[2H,2D,2C,2S,3H,3D,3C,3S,4H,4D,4C,4S,5H,5D,5C,5S]"
