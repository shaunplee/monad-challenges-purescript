title: Generalizing Random Pairs
---

Use the provided `rand` function and your `randLetter` function to make a function
that generates a random pair of a Char and an Int.

    randPair :: Gen (Tuple Char Int)

Generate the letter first, then generate the number using the seed acquired from
generating the letter.  When you give this function `(mkSeed 1)` it gives you the
random pair `Tuple 'l' 23709`.

Here we're starting to see the `Gen` type synonym pay off.  Without `Gen`, the type
would have been:

    randPair :: Seed -> (Tuple Seed (Tuple Char Int))

Still understandable, but the nested tuples are starting to obscure things
slightly.

You have just composed two generators. Now generalize the composition to
`generalPair`, and make sure that the second argument receive the seed
generated by the first argument.

    generalPair :: forall a b. Gen a -> Gen b -> Gen (Tuple a b)

This function makes the `Gen` type synonym almost essential.  Here's what we would
have had to write if we didn't have `Gen`:

    generalPair :: forall a b. (Seed -> (Tuple Seed a)) -> (Seed -> (Tuple Seed b)) -> (Seed -> (Tuple Seed (Tuple a b)))

Removing the unnecessary parentheses gets us this type signature, which might
help you a little when implementing the function.

    generalPair :: forall a b. (Seed -> Tuple Seed a) -> (Seed -> Tuple Seed b) -> Seed -> Tuple Seed (Tuple a b)

Write another version `randPair_` using `generalPair`, and test it by comparing
its output to what you got from `randPair`.

## Generalizing Pairs Even More

This `generalPair` function can be generalized even more. Instead of always
constructing pairs, you should be able to have a generalization that can
construct anything. Your result shouldn't be fixed to `Gen (Tuple a b)`. It should
also be able to be `Gen String`, `Gen Polynomial`, or `Gen BlogPost`. All you
need to do is pass in a function that does the constructing with two inputs.
Call this even more generalized function `generalB`. Once you have it implemented,
write a new `generalPair2` function in terms of `generalB`.
