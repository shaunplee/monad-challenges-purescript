title: Do Notation â€“ operators
---

In the last exercise, we noted that the following code:

    rule1 = do
        foo <- calcFoo
        bar foo

Is automatically de-sugared to:

    rule1 = bind calcFoo (\foo -> bar foo)

In PureScript, the `bind` function is conventionally written as the `>>=`
operator, which can be written infix style like this:

    rule1 = calcFoo >>= (\foo -> bar foo)

In order for the do syntax to work correctly, we need to change our `Monad` class
to have a `>>=` operator. Create a class like this and add an infix definition:

    class Monad m where
        bind :: forall a b. m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
        pure :: forall a. a -> m a

    infix 1 bind as >>=

In the next few sections, we will be rewriting the earlier exercises using do syntax.
