title: The Maybe Type
---

You may have noticed that MCPrelude doesn't have the `Maybe` type or anything
from Data.Maybe.  That's because you're going to build it all yourself.

**IMPORTANT**
Again, it is imperative that you DO NOT CHEAT.  Don't look at any of the `Maybe`
stuff from Prelude or Data.Maybe.  Don't do it.  Nobody is forcing you to do
these exercises, so you should try to get the maximum possible benefit.
**IMPORTANT**

First of all, you need to define the `Maybe` type. It should be able to
represent any value `a`, as well as the case where no value `a` exists. This
type needs to represent failing values of any type, so it needs a type variable
similar to what we saw in the `Gen` type synonym. But this can't be a type
synonym because it has two constructors. Write this type yourself and get it to
compile. Once you've gotten it compiling, check your answer by [hex
decoding](http://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexDecode) the following:

    64617461204D617962652061203D204E6F7468696E67207C204A7573742061

You should use this definition and names going forward.  We just wanted you to
work on it yourself first.

Then for convenience write a `Show` instance for this new type.

    instance showMaybe :: Show a => Show (Maybe a) where
      show :: (Maybe a) -> String

If you're having trouble with this, here is the [hex
encoded](http://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexDecode) instance.

    696E7374616E63652073686F774D61796265203A3A2053686F772061203D3E2053686F7720284D617962652061292077686572650D0A202073686F77203A3A20284D61796265206129202D3E20537472696E670D0A202073686F77204E6F7468696E67203D20224E6F7468696E67220D0A202073686F7720284A757374206129203D20224A7573742022203C3E2073686F772061

You are also going to need an `Eq` instance as well.

    instance eqMaybe :: Eq a => Eq (Maybe a) where
      eq :: Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Boolean

We're not going to give you the answer to this one.  In the worst case
scenario you should be able to figure it out from the way the `Show` instance
was done.

On the other hand, if writing these instances was too difficult, it might be
good to go study some more introductory PureScript materials before continuing
here.
