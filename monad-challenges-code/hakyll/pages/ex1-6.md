title: Threading the random number state
---

In the previous exercise we wrote something that handled the threading of state
through a list of generators.  A simpler idea is to have a function that does
one step of two generators and the necessary state threading.  Now write a
function called `genTwo` that does this.  Its first argument will be a
generator.  Its second argument will be a function that takes the result of
the first generator and returns a second generator.  The type signature looks
like this:

    genTwo :: Gen a -> (a -> Gen b) -> Gen b

Implement this function. <!-- (TODO: Test cases needed) -->

Now look at the implementation of your `repRandom` function.  It probably has one
clause handling the empty list case.  That case probably looks something like this:

    repRandom [] s = Tuple s []

or maybe you used `Tuple s []` as a starting point for a fold.

`repRandom` was expecting a list of generators and it's supposed to return a
generator. In the empty list case it has no incoming generators to work with
but it still has to return one. Essentially what's happening here is that it
has to construct a `Gen` out of thin air. It turns out that this is a really
common pattern. So let's make a function for it. We'll call this function
`mkGen`. It has to return a `Gen a`. But it has to get the a from somewhere, so
that will have to be the argument.

Implement `mkGen`. Try to figure out the type signature yourself, but if you
need help here it is hex-encoded: 6D6B47656E203A3A20666F72616C6C20612E2061202D3E2047656E2061. You

Congrats! You have finished the first set. There are a few repeating patterns
lurking around. Lets see more examples in the following two sets, and we will
provide a unified approach in Set 4. Don't jump ahead! We have not seen all of
them!
