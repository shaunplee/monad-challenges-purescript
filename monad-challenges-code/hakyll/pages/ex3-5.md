title: Combinations of more things
---

You probably noticed that `allCombs3` is getting painful to write.  Worse still,
it does not help us generate combinations of four or more things.  We need to
take a different approach if we want this to scale easily.  This is a
difficult step, so we are not going to make you figure it out yourself.  All
the same, spend some time thinking about how you might do it.  Here is a hint
though.  You probably noticed that `allCombs` has `(Array a -> Array b)` in its
type signature and `allCombs3` has `(Array a -> Array b -> Array c)` in its type
signature.  When you are playing with this, do not try to generalize that
pattern to `Array (Array a)`. That is not an adequate generalization because it
only allows `a` and has no `b` or `c` anywhere.  Spend some time thinking about
this before you continue.  But don't be discouraged if you can't figure it out.
This one is hard.

Back?  If you figured it out, congratulations.  If not, here is the
[hex](http://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexDecode) encoded type
signature for a function called `combStep` that is the generalization we need.

Now write that function. Then use the `combStep` function to implement `allCombs`
and `allCombs3` and check that the new implementations have the same behavior as
before. Once you do this it should be pretty obvious how you would use `combStep`
to implement `allCombs4` and beyond. Also notice how `combStep` compares to
`allCombs`.
