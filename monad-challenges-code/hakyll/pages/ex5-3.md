title: Do Notation â€“  Set 1
---

First, create an instance of `Monad` for your `Gen` newtype, similar to what you did in Set 4.
You will also probably want to create an `evalGen :: forall a. Gen a -> Seed -> a` function as well.

With your `Monad` instance, you should be able to use do syntax. Recall that in Set 1 we had
a function called `rand :: Seed -> (Tuple Seed Int)`. Create a new function
`makeRandom :: Gen Int` which wraps the `rand` function inside your new type.

Next, use do syntax to re-create the following function from Set 1:

    fiveRands :: Gen (Array Int)

To check that you created this function correctly, recall that the product of the five numbers
you generate when passing in a seed of `mkSeed 1` is 492745054.

Once that has been created correctly, create `randLetter :: Gen Char` and use it to create
`randString3 :: Gen String`, which creates a `String` of three random characters. If you have an initial seed of 1, when you use [this site](http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) to
calculate the SHA-256 hash of the output of randString3, you get
6b70649415be2833ee195809e02c7911a9be16b68fa07d10b4a644efa177798a.

Lastly, go ahead and create this general function:

    generalPair :: forall a b. Gen a -> Gen b -> Gen (Tuple a b)
